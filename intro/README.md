# How to apply to be a Django Girls coach?

To become a Django Girls coach all you should do is:

* go to the djangogirls.org page and look for an event you can help with,
* fill in coach application form on the event website,
* alternatively you can drop us a line at hello@djangogirls.org and ask about next events.

Most of our workshops are done in English, so we expect you to speak it fluently. However, it is possible that some of the local events will be done in other languages - you should ask about it local Django Girls organizers.

## How much time you'll spend as a coach?

Django Girls is designed to be one-day workshop. However, sometimes the event could take two days. Apart from time you will spend coaching, there is a number of things you need to consider, which will take some of your time:

* Getting know your group - we encourage to say hi and meet with your group before the workshop. It means: writing e-mail to introduce yourself, possibly a chat via hangout or Skype with all the people in your group (__~1-2h__).
* Helping out with installation before the workshops - it is either done via Skype/Google hangout/e-mails or a day before the workshop. You will need __3+ hours__ for that.
* During some Django Girls events there will be pre- or post-workshop meetup (__~1-3h__).

# Tutorial

During Django Girls we're using a tutorial that was written from scratch for this workshop. You can find it here: http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/

During the course of tutorial, you should be able to accomplish the whole thing in 7-8 hours: write a complete blog application in Django and deploy it to Heroku.

Tutorial covers:
* Simple explanation of how the Internet works.
* Installation of Python, Django etc..
* Creating Django app.
* Django models, views, urls, templates.
* Basics of HTML and CSS. Using Bootstrap and Google Fonts.
* Deploy on Heroku.

## Our approach

Tutorial is completely beginner-friendly. Attendee literally doesn't have to know how the Internet works - we are explaining it!

We're avoiding technical terms and we aren't assuming that attendees already know anything. We explain everything with real life examples and always try to bring the bigger picture.

At times, the material might seem unnecessarily dense to you, as if going through extra hoops. That is on purpose -- we believe this will give the best results. Let them explore and understand it on their own.

The tutorial is designed to expose attendees to as many Django errors as possible. It is very important for us to show that dealing with errors is a part of being a programmer. When they will go back home they should be able to find the solution for errors on their own.

We want our coaches to follow, if possible, some rules, we wrote down in next sections.
