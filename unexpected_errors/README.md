# Unexpected errors

So tutorial is going very well - all instructions are clear and works... and then boom! the unexpected error! The attendee is confused, you try to figure out, what's wrong and you start to look at the error on your own. Please, stop at this moment and restrain yourself of fixing that alone.

It is so much better to find the solution together. Even if the error is very, very hard - like finding bugs in Python or certain OS distributions.

* try to search the error in the Internet. Even if you know the answer it is good to make the attendee to try finding some information on their own. And then go back to you.
* ask them what do they think is broken and listen carefully. The way they describe it will probably give you a great insight which parts they understand and which you should explain a little bit better.
* work together to fix the problem. Make sure they understand what you are trying to achieve - explain what are you looking for, what are you checking, etc.. Make sure __they__ are fixing problem with your help, not you fixing magically something for them.
* knowing that many people had the same problem before is very enpowering.
