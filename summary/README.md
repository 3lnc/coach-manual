# After the Workshop

If you don't mind spending some time helping people after the workshop, we will encourage you to stay in touch with your team. It is great to have a mentor - somebody to ask the question if you are stuck with something.

## Share your experience with us

Teaching others is a very hard thing. You will learn a lot during the workshop and we will be happy to hear about your experiences as a coach.

Please share all your findings with us. We will make the tutorial better and more complete.

Drop us a line at hello@djangogirls.org.


## Stay in touch with your group

As much as possible, please stay in touch with your group after the event. Answer their question, encourage them to follow on with programming or invite them
to your local Python meetup. It's super important to have a friendly face in community.
