# Tutorial

During Django Girls we're using a tutorial that was written from scratch for this workshop. You can find it here: http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/

During the course of tutorial, you should be able in 7-8 hours accomplish the whole thing: write a complete blog application in Django and deploy it to Heroku.

## Our approach

Tutorial is completely beginner-friendly. Attendee literally doesn't have to know how the internet works - we are explaining it too.

We're not using technical terms and assume that they already know something. We explain everything with real life examples and always trying to bring the bigger picture.

At times, the material might seem unnecessarily dense to you, as if going through extra hoops. That is on purpose -- we believe this will give the best results. Let them explore and understand it on their own.

### Hands-on! Coaching vs teaching

During the workshop you'll work in a small group of 3 learners. It's a hands-on, experience oriented workshop. You'll stand by on the sidelines, not in front of them.

Coach has to be 100% focused on learners, always there when needed. Make sure their experience is positive and they have fun. Do not judge, be helpful and appriciate their (in-)abilities.

### Words

At all time, you need to be super careful about the words you use.

#### No jargon

It's hard, but it's possible. Do not use words that kids wouldn't understand.

#### No "it's easy"

For your learners it's probably the hardest thing ever. Saying them that "it's easy" is not cool.

#### No feigning surprise

You shouldn't act surprised when people say they don't know something. Not knowing something (technical or not) is a totally acceptable thing at Django Girls.

#### No well-actually's

A well-actually happens when someone says something that's almost - but not entirely - correct, and you say, "well, actually…" and then give a minor correction. This is especially annoying when the correction has no bearing on the actual conversation.

#### No subtle -isms

Subtle -isms are small things that make others feel uncomfortable, things that we all sometimes do by mistake. For example, saying "It's so easy my grandmother could do it" is a subtle -ism. Like the other three social rules, this one is often accidentally broken. Like the other three, it's not a big deal to mess up – you just apologize and move on.

### Learn from mistakes

We want our attendees to really understand what they're doing, so they're not only copy-pasting the code, but actually learn something. That's why we chose the "learn from mistakes" approach here.

Over the course of the tutorial you'll see that we're trying to first steer things into an error, bug or mistake. Make attendee read the bug report and __understand it__. More importantly, we're trying to teach them that bugs aren't scary and error pages are their friends. This approach will go a long way later.

### Learn that coding is fun

The goal of the workshop is not to build a website. It is not to teach the whole Django. It is also not to teach programming.

The ultimate goal is to show that code is fun. __To make people excited.__ To show them that programming is not scary and it is for everyone. To show them how powerful programming skills can be.

This excitement and passion will then drive them to spend endless hours trying to figure all of this out.

### Atmosphere

Excitement is good, but stress is bad for learning. We care really badly about atmosphere and giving our attendees great first experience with coding.

Imagine this: You're trying to do something difficult. You're in a room full of strangers who know how to do it better than you. You don't know how to articulate your questions. You don't know the right names for everything.

For most people, this is super umcofortable and stressful situation. It doesn't have to be. You're there to make it easier. Here is what you can do:

- Smile!
- Make eye contact
- Admit that you don't know everything
- It's ok to make lots of mistakes
- It's ok to get frustrated
- Use normal language, not jargon!
- Assume everyone you're coaching has zero knowledge but infinite intelligence
- Go on their pace, not your pace.
- Be friendly and kind
- Use their name
- Make sure they know they're awesome!
- Ask them if they need help -- some people are afraid to ask
- Emphasize that there is no such thing as "dumb" questions
- Don't say "Any questions?" Say "What questions do you have?"
- Talk sssssslllllloooooowwwwwwllllllyyyyyyyy.
- Wait much longer than you feel is comfortable for questions/comments.

### Removing the roadblocks

#### Fear

Big obstacle we try to remove is fear. In most of the world, but especially school and work, people are afraid of looking stupid. This fear frequently keeps us from asking important questions like "how does that work?" or even just "why?".

Fear of making mistake also keeps them from making progress.

#### Impostor syndrome

Madeline Kunin's research: women self-filter more than men.

The impostor syndrome is a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments. Despite external evidence of their competence, those with the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved. __The impostor syndrome is particularly common among women.__

To fight impostor syndrome:
- Don't accept any learner saying they are too whatever to do it, answer that they can do it.
- Congratulate people on their achievements, take some time to let them show them to you.
- Do compliment.
- Show them that they actually *know* things.

### Answering questions

We do not roll our eyes or laugh at questions. We do not debate which programming language, methods or technologies are "better".

We always answer __positively__:
- I’m glad you said that
- Great question
- Hm, I'm not sure... Let's look in the Internet/ask someone else.

### No back-seat driving

Imagine that: their keyboard is made of lava. LAVA! You wouldn't touch it, right?

Whenever you take over their keyboard, learners are going to drift away. This can be offputting and even scary.

We're sure you can explain it and instruct them with your words only (it's actually a cool exercise for you too!). If you absolutely, ultimatively **must** type something on their computer — chances are you don't —, ask whether that is okay with them and explain what are you doing.

Ask: "Do you mind if I type?" or "May I?".

### Show them how they can teach themselves

They will only spend 8 hours with you, but they will have to spend many many many more hours teaching themselves. Fortunately, you can make it easier for them!

__Make them Google stuff__ - do not give straight answers just to make it faster. It doesn't matter if you will be going faster or slower -- what matter is if they're going to fall in love with it or not.

__Ask about their ideas__ - "How would you solve it?", "What do you think?". Make them figure it out on their own. You know they know it, right?
